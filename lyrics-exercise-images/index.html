		<h3>Verse</h3>
		<p>
			Like a rabbit in headlights<br>
			They're stunned by all your charm<br>
			And I feel so damn lucky<br>
			To have you on my arm<br><br>

			And I can't help but wonder<br>
			<div>
		
	</div>
			How we ended up alright<br>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			And I love you like no other<br>
			'Cause this has never celt so right<br><br>
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus</h3>
		<p id="chorus">
			Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br>
			Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br><br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse</h3>
		<p>
			I want to treat you something special<br>
			Give you what you deserve<br>
			I want to take you to paradise<br>
			In a 1950's Merc<br><br>
		
			And I can’t help but wonder<br>
			Just how we ended up alright<br>
			And I love you like no other<br>
			And this has never felt so right<br><br>
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus</h3>
		<p id="chorus">
			You can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br>
			You can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br><br>
		</p>
		<h3>Verse</h3>
		<p>
			Girl you can keep me warm<br>
			You can keep me real warm<br><br>
			
			There’s just one thing<br>
			
			Girl you could have anyone<br>
			So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own<br>
			Girl you could be with anyone<br>
			So thanks for making me your number one<br><br>
		</p>
		<h3>Chorus</h3>
		<p id="chorus">
			You can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br>
			Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br>
			Yeah wrap me up and keep warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br>
			Oh yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night<br>
			Warm on a cold cold night<br>
